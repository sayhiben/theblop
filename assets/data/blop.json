We are demanding a country that puts our families over their fortunes‚Äîpublic schools over private profits, healthcare over hedge funds, housing over homelessness.\n\nMusk, Trump and their fellow profiteers are trying to create a race to the bottom‚Äîon wages, on benefits, on dignity itself. They want to erase labor rights, break our unions, and silence immigrant voices.\n\nMay Day 2025 we are standing united. We're organizing for a world where every family has housing, healthcare, fair wages, union protection, and safety‚Äîregardless of race, zip code, or immigration status.\n\nThey‚Äôre defunding our schools, privatizing public services, attacking unions, and targeting immigrant families with fear and violence. This is a war on working people‚Äîand we will not stand down. Using the principles of nonviolence and peaceful protest, we will stand together and stand strong.\n\nThis May Day, we will turn the page. This is the beginning of a new era‚Äîone where working families lead, immigrants are protected, and no one is left behind. This is not charity. This is not a request. We are reclaiming our power from corporate elites, and we will not be intimidated by Trump, Musk, or their billionaire backers. They‚Äôve ruled for too long. Their time is up.\n\nSTOP THE BILLIONAIRE TAKEOVER. WE ARE THE MANY. THEY ARE THE FEW. THIS IS MAY DAY. JOIN US.",
