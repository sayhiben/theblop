Together, we’ll set a national record for the most circuses held in a single day while we simultaneously refuse to celebrate a petty clown who desperately wants to be seen as strong. We won’t stop until we build the country we all deserve. Our grassroots street circuses turn satire into resistance and reclaim the big tent for democracy.\n\nFor this event, we will gather in a private room at Chickie and Pete's Atlantic City, where we can eat, socialize, and hear from special guests. There will be activities for kids like face painting and some supplies to make signs (everyone is welcome to bring their own signs of course!).\n\nFrom there, we will proceed to the board walk and walk holding our signs!",

It is also Flag Day.\nIndivisible Lambertville-New Hope (ILNH), along with our partners in the Indivisible One New Jersey (IONJ) coalition, is taking action on this day of defiance to reject authoritarianism. In doing so, we are sending a message to President Trump: No Kings! The American flag belongs to all of us!\nWhat we will do:\nWe will perform a “card stunt.” We will gather on a large field and hold cards that together create two field-sized images: one supporting our democracy, and the other, reclaiming the American Flag. A drone will capture the event and we will share it on social media as a kickoff to No Kings Day.\nWe will use our democratic muscle to display a unified message of what we believe. The event will be powerful and full of joy!\nJoin this fun in the morning, then head to a larger rally if you wish. We might even caravan to another event!\nWe will also need lots of volunteers to help with logistics, ahead of time and on event day, for tasks like those listed below.
