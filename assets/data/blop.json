Join as long as you'd like.\n\nPolitics\nI just saw the Reddit post regarding Eric Burilson calling those who attend Town Halls \"nutjobs.\" The timing couldn't be more funny, because this week I've been communicating with his office directly to request a Public Town Hall, which he's outright refused. I've informed them that we plan to organize this week for folks to demand accountability. The event has been cleared by the city. Feel free to join with your signs, questions, concerns, or stories for as long as you like. Even if you just want to come for 15 minutes during your lunch break, we'd love to have you.\n\nFor the record, Eric Burilson has NEVER held a public Town Hall. Instead, he holds \"Tele-Town Halls\" where all questions are pre-screened or pre-selected. They say this it to prohibit people from screaming or causing a scene. And they claim they screening is to ensure people aren't asking repeated questions. But I guarantee you, they will now allow a single question to be asked that they don't want to answer. That isn't facilitating civil discourse....it's avoiding accountability.\n\nRegardless of where you stand, it should be an expectation, not a privilege, to directly engage with your Congressman. This isn't about red or blue, this is about democracy. This is a peaceful protest, and we intend to be civil yet firm.\n\nThe address is as follows.\nBurlison Springfield District Office\n3232 E.

Join us for an online Intro to Bannering, a visual tactic Backbone Campaign has been leading on for the last 23 years! Thursday, March 13th at 5pm Pacific /7pm Central /8pm Eastern RSVP for the zoom link. At this workshop, we'll walk through the materials we use and how to put together a banner. We'll show you how to \"rig\" your banner to poles and tips for safely and legally deploying it on a freeway overpass. (These banners also work great in marches, at events behind a speaker, at intersections, ferry terminals and more.) We'll provide info on how you can get one of our banner kits to create and deploy banners in your community - or if you want to source your own materials, we'll have suggestions on resources. Overpass bannering is a highly visible and 100% legal way for folks to take action together. It only takes 2-4 people and an hour of time to reach tens of thousands of people and make them feel less alone - and maybe inspire them to stand up as well!",

Gone are thousands of civil service workers across the United States and foreign countries, with thousands more to follow. Abruptly fired staff include air traffic controllers and workers at nuclear plants. They're canceling leases for offices nationwide that house Social Security, Indian Health Board, CIA, CDC, NIH, Small Business Administration, Public Defender Service, US Fish and Wildlife, Farm Service Administration, Geological Survey, Mine Safety, FBI, EPA, and countless more programs critical to the functioning of our government and society. They've pulled the plug on all DEIA policies, launched mass deportations, broken the Department of Justice, installed an \"Office of Faith\" in the White House, ransacked the Department of Education, IRS, and Social Security, and removed all guardrails that have kept such abuse of power in check. And that's just a few of their ongoing illegal and unconstitutional \"efficiencies.\"\n\nJoin us to say NO to the wanton, sadistic, racist, bigoted, and corrupt plans of the Heritage Foundation, an ultraconservative think tank backed by billionaires.",
