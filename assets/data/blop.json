Irene Vista in Tucson Please note the time change from our usual\n\nWorker safety was the major story of the COVID pandemic. Essential workers were thrown into deadly danger to service the rest of us - without protections! Eventually workers organized in ways never seen before - organizing campaigns led by workers started happening in Starbucks, Amazon and the agro-industry. Public support for workers & unions reached an all-time high Point.\n\nThe first Trump administration forced meatpacking workers back to the job in spite of deadly conditions in the food factories. The many botched policies related to the pandemic made the US the butt joke for the rest of the world. Unions gained more power to protect its members and build strong alliances with unorganized workers.\n\nSafety has come a long way. Its ability to organize and fight corporate overreach is huge. Which is why it's under attack. We must demand HANDS OFF of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA). We also need to protect injured workers' rights to proper healthcare, disability insurance(SDI), Medicaid, and a National Labor Relations Board that protects their right to unionize. It took decades of struggle for working people to win some protections from greedy corporate bosses. We need to protest. We need to organize. We need more creative ways to struggle.\n\nCome hear testimonies of workers and advocates for lifting up worker safety. The end of April is the time of year to call attention to workplace safety. Arizona loses a hundred workers per year to traumatic fatal deaths. An estimated two thousand workers die from exposure to health hazards such as heat or chemical exposure. Tens of thousands are seriously injured by work - often to be challenged and degraded by a Worker compensation system that devalues them and treats them like trash.\n\nThere’s no a better issue for workers to organize around - come hear how it works\n\nFor more information about Salt of the Earth Labor College please email to SELC@webtv.net or call (520)325-0694. We will be depending on your generosity to keep us going. We still need to maintain our building, pay for insurance, property taxes, and do mailings, etc. You can mail checks to- Salt of the Earth Labor College, 1902 East Irene Vista, Tucson AZ 85713\n\n1902 E.
