Delaware St.\n\nThe people will meet up on Mass Ave to stand in solidarity with the transgender community and demand an end to the relentless attacks on trans rights in Indiana. As right-wing politicians push 15 anti-trans bills targeting healthcare, education, sports, and more, we must unite our struggles for LGBTQ liberation, racial justice, gender equality, and workers‚Äô rights into one powerful movement. We can build a future where everyone can live with dignity, safety, and freedom.\n\nWe refuse to let the ruling class scapegoat trans people for their failures. Trans rights are human rights, and we will fight to protect them! From healthcare access to education, trans people are under siege, but we know our struggles are interconnected. The same politicians attacking trans rights are also cutting funding for public schools, attacking workers‚Äô unions, and rolling back civil rights protections. We will show them workers cannot be divided.\n\nThese attacks include bills like IN HB1041, which bans transgender students from participating in sports consistent with their gender identity, and IN HB1341, which prohibits changes to gender markers on birth certificates, denying trans people the right to accurate identification. Meanwhile, IN HB1428 allows healthcare providers to deny care to trans individuals based on ‚Äúconscience,‚Äù and IN SB0479 criminalizes assisting minors in accessing gender-affirming care, threatening families and providers with felony charges. These bills are part of a broader agenda to divide and distract the working class while the billionaire class consolidates power.\n\nJoin us as we rally to defend trans rights, resist bigotry, and fight for a future where everyone can thrive.",

Help support this idea. On April 1st call or visit your respective Republican Senator and Representatives offices and tell them in no uncertain term that you will not be treated as a fool any longer. Tell them that you vote. Tell them that you will hold them accountable for the Trump ‚Äì Musk anti-democracy actions that are occurring. Drive your car, charter a bus (like me), walk, ride a bike. Make your voice heard. Be prepared, be peaceful, be persistent.\nOn this April Fools Day tell Republicans that you are not a fool and that you will NOT BE FOOLED any longer.\nWe have power.
