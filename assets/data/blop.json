We are demanding a country that puts our families over their fortunes—public schools over private profits, healthcare over hedge funds, housing over homelessness.\n\nMusk, Trump and their fellow profiteers are trying to create a race to the bottom—on wages, on benefits, on dignity itself. They want to erase labor rights, break our unions, and silence immigrant voices.\n\nMay Day 2025 we are fighting back. Organizing for a world where every family has housing, healthcare, fair wages, union protection, and safety—regardless of race, zip code, or immigration status.\n\nThey're defunding our schools, privatizing public services, attacking unions, and targeting immigrant families with fear and violence. This is a war on working people, and we will not stand down. This day of action is just the beginning. We're organizing not just for one day, but to build power in every neighborhood, on every shop floor, and in every school.\n\nLocation\nTorrance City Hall, Torrance Boulevard, Torrance, CA 90503, United States of America\nTorrance Boulevard, 90503, Torrance\n\nDate and time\nOn Saturday, May 3, 2025 starting at 12:00 PM\n\nOrganized by\nIndivisible South Bay Los Angeles",
