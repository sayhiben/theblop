In protest of the wide variety of Trump–Musk led anti-democratic activities that are occurring, I decided to organize a motorcoach protest trip to NC Senators Tillis and Budd’s Raleigh field offices. I’m calling it my “We Are Not Fools” protest. In only 2 days I filled a 50 person motor coach with friends and neighbors who want to be heard. It is a long shot to expect a meeting with a Senator. I’m hopeful for a meeting with staff. I won’t be surprised if neither occurs and we have a walking protest.\nYou can do it too! Help support this idea. On April 1st call or visit your respective Republican Senator and Representatives offices and tell them in no uncertain term that you will not be treated as a fool any longer. Tell them that you vote. Tell them that you will hold them accountable for the Trump – Musk anti-democracy actions that are occurring. Drive your car, charter a bus (like me), walk, ride a bike. Make your voice heard. Be prepared, be peaceful, be persistent.\nOn this April Fools Day tell Republicans that you are not a fool and that you will NOT BE FOOLED any longer.\nWe have power. USE IT.\n#wearenotfools\n@rangmran.bsky.social See less",
