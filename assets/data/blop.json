Gone are thousands of civil service workers across the United States and foreign countries, with thousands more to follow. Abruptly fired staff include air traffic controllers and workers at nuclear plants. They're canceling leases for offices nationwide that house Social Security, Indian Health Board, CIA, CDC, NIH, Small Business Administration, Public Defender Service, US Fish and Wildlife, Farm Service Administration, Geological Survey, Mine Safety, FBI, EPA, and countless more programs critical to the functioning of our government and society. They've pulled the plug on all DEIA policies, launched mass deportations, broken the Department of Justice, installed an \"Office of Faith\" in the White House, ransacked the Department of Education, IRS, and Social Security, and removed all guardrails that have kept such abuse of power in check. And that's just a few of their ongoing illegal and unconstitutional \"efficiencies.\"\n\nJoin us to say NO to the wanton, sadistic, racist, bigoted, and corrupt plans of the Heritage Foundation, an ultraconservative think tank backed by billionaires.",

The event organizers aim to oppose various political actions described in the text.

At this event, we will present brand-new songs of protest at the most fitting location: the Stonewall Inn— the site of the 1969 Stonewall riots, which ignited the gay liberation movement and the modern fight for LGBTQ+ rights in the United States. The event will feature the Bowers Fader Duo, Laurie Towers/John Pietaro Duo and many composer/performers in works by Lynn Bechtold, Seth Boustead, Frank Brickle, Shanan Estreicher, Gilbert Galindo, Patrick Grant, Eugene W. McBride, Carmen Moore, Gene Pritsker, Carolyn Steinberg, Randall Woolf.",

No replies? We're going to Harrisburg and confronting Legislators face-to-face.\n\nCalls, letters, and Zoom meetings with elected officials have their place, and we've done plenty of them. But there's nothing quite like looking a shifty politician in the eye and asking a straightforward, no-nonsense question.\n\nThis Monday, March 24th, we are going to the Capitol and we are bringing our video equipment. After months of inaction from the House and Senate, we need you to join us as we escalate the pressure. We're going to send a message to both Democrat and GOP leadership that we are not giving up our fight to convince our state government to do the right thing: take a stand against corruption and Pass a Gift Ban.\n\nIf you've ever wanted to be a little more direct with our frozen, corporate-indentured \"leaders\" in Harrisburg, come and join us on 3/24. This is a non-arrestable action.\n\n9am: Meet Up & Training at Elementary Coffee | Address: 256 North St, Harrisburg, PA 17101\n\nSPONSORED BY\nMarchOnHarrisburg",
