Trump’s tacky parade was inspired by dictators he idolizes, and will cost taxpayers nearly $100 million.\n\nJune 14 is our chance to reflect the absurdity of the MAGA regime and the clowns who lead it. To meet this moment, Women’s March will host community circuses nationwide—bold, creative actions that mirror the chaos MAGA has sown across the country. Together, we’ll set a national record for the most circuses held in a single day while we simultaneously refuse to celebrate a petty clown who desperately wants to be seen as strong. We won’t stop until we build the country we all deserve. Our grassroots street circuses turn satire into resistance and reclaim the big tent for democracy.\n\nFor this event, we will gather in a private room at Chickie and Pete's Atlantic City, where we can eat, socialize, and hear from special guests. There will be activities for kids like face painting and some supplies to make signs (everyone is welcome to bring their own signs of course!).\n\nFrom there, we will proceed to the board walk and walk holding our signs!",
