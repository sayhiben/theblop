Lauren Boebert cast an enthusiastic YES for the GOP's Big Ugly Bill that will - kick 12 million Americans off of their health insurance - reduce food stamp benefits for thousands of working families - create the single largest increase in the national debt in history - give over $5 Billion in handouts to out-of-state billionaires No wonder, the bill is wildly unpopular among Americans of both parties. Yet over the past month, Republican support for the bill increased by 17% in the face of misleading statements and partisan propaganda. We need to get out the word to Boebert's constituents and make sure they understand the truth about this bill. Boebert stands with billionaires, not with us.",
