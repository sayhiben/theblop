It's a good time and we get a lot of positive feedback from passing cars. It might seem like a small thing but every little bit helps. And it feels good to do something so come on down!\n\nElon Musk and DOGE are engaged in an administrative coup of the federal government. They have taken control of the federal payment system and are unilaterally suspending funds appropriated by congress, in clear violation of the Constitution.\n\nThey have already caused immense harm by dismantling USAID and have set their sights on everything from the FAA to Social Security next. Make no mistake, their end goal is the destruction of the US Federal Government and its ability to check corporate power and provide basic services to citizens.\n\nHow this develops in Washington remains to be seen, but as US citizens we can exercise our 1st Amendment right to peacefully protest. Elon Musk's net worth is largely based on Tesla stock, which is currently valued at 20X that of other car companies. Driving down the share price is a direct attack on Elon's power.\n\nThis is a non-violent action to raise awareness and help to drive down Tesla stock. We can legally protest on the sidewalk as long as we don't obstruct pedestrian or vehicle traffic. This location has plenty of room on the sidewalk and visibility to passing cars.",

Gone are thousands of civil service workers across the United States and foreign countries, with thousands more to follow. Abruptly fired staff include air traffic controllers and workers at nuclear plants. They're canceling leases for offices nationwide that house Social Security, Indian Health Board, CIA, CDC, NIH, Small Business Administration, Public Defender Service, US Fish and Wildlife, Farm Service Administration, Geological Survey, Mine Safety, FBI, EPA, and countless more programs critical to the functioning of our government and society. They've pulled the plug on all DEIA policies, launched mass deportations, broken the Department of Justice, installed an \"Office of Faith\" in the White House, ransacked the Department of Education, IRS, and Social Security, and removed all guardrails that have kept such abuse of power in check. And that's just a few of their ongoing illegal and unconstitutional \"efficiencies.\"\n\nJoin us to say NO to the wanton, sadistic, racist, bigoted, and corrupt plans of the Heritage Foundation, an ultraconservative think tank backed by billionaires.",

The event organizers aim to oppose various political actions described in the text.

But there's nothing quite like looking a shifty politician in the eye and asking a straightforward, no-nonsense question.\n\nThis Monday, March 24th, we are going to the Capitol and we are bringing our video equipment. After months of inaction from the House and Senate, we need you to join us as we escalate the pressure. We're going to send a message to both Democrat and GOP leadership that we are not giving up our fight to convince our state government to do the right thing: take a stand against corruption and Pass a Gift Ban.\n\nIf you've ever wanted to be a little more direct with our frozen, corporate-indentured \"leaders\" in Harrisburg, come and join us on 3/24. This is a non-arrestable action.\n\n9am: Meet Up & Training at Elementary Coffee | Address: 256 North St, Harrisburg, PA 17101\n\nSPONSORED BY\nMarchOnHarrisburg",
    "raw_summary": "The flyer announces a protest event called \"March on Harrisburg,\" scheduled for March 24, 2025. Participants are encouraged to join to hold state legislators accountable, demand democracy protection, and advocate for the passing of a Gift Ban. The event starts at Harrisburg State Capitol, with an initial meeting and training session at Elementary Coffee. The protest is described as non-arrestable and aims to pressure political leaders through direct action. Contact and more information are available via an email and a website link. The event is sponsored by MarchOnHarrisburg."
