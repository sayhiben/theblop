These attacks are happening as working families across our state are already struggling to keep up with the rising costs of healthcare, insurance, housing, and utilities, and as the damages from extreme storms, flooding, heatwaves, and wildfires continue increasing.\n\nJoin us in Camden for a town hall on these challenges and potential solutions — like the NJ Climate Superfund Act, which would ensure that the world’s wealthiest fossil fuel corporations, not taxpayers, foot the bill for climate disasters.\n\nWe’ll be joined by municipal leaders who have taken local action in support of this bill. We’ll also hear from community members who have been impacted by the climate crisis, local climate and environmental leaders, and more.\n\nJoin us to learn about these issues and how you can take action to support critical policy solutions that invest in our health, environment, and economy here in New Jersey!",

We’ll also hear from community members who have been impacted by the climate crisis, local climate and environmental leaders, and more.\n\nJoin us to learn about these issues and how you can take action to support critical policy solutions that invest in our health, environment, and economy here in New Jersey!",
