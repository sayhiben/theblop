Together, we’ll protest:\n- The Trump administration’s abuse of executive power, including its attacks on congressional authority, judicial independence, and the separation of powers.\n- The SAVE Act, a voter suppression bill targeting women and low-income Americans.\n- The potential misuse of the Insurrection Act of 1807, which could criminalize peaceful protest and undermine First Amendment rights.\n\nThese threats are real—and they demand action. We remain committed to peaceful protest, grassroots organizing, and defending those most at risk.\n📥 Food Drive\nBring non-perishable food items (no glass or cans) to support our community.\n📢 Stay Connected\nFind us on Facebook, Bluesky, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube by visiting our website: https://linktr.ee/nj50501\nFor press inquiries: NJ50501press@gmail.com .\nStand with us on April 19th as we fight for democracy, justice, and the power of the people!",
