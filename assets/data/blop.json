Join as long as you'd like.\n\nPolitics\nI just saw the Reddit post regarding Eric Burilson calling those who attend Town Halls \"nutjobs.\" The timing couldn't be more funny, because this week I've been communicating with his office directly to request a Public Town Hall, which he's outright refused. I've informed them that we plan to organize this week for folks to demand accountability. The event has been cleared by the city. Feel free to join with your signs, questions, concerns, or stories for as long as you like. Even if you just want to come for 15 minutes during your lunch break, we'd love to have you.\n\nFor the record, Eric Burilson has NEVER held a public Town Hall. Instead, he holds \"Tele-Town Halls\" where all questions are pre-screened or pre-selected. They say this it to prohibit people from screaming or causing a scene. And they claim they screening is to ensure people aren't asking repeated questions. But I guarantee you, they will now allow a single question to be asked that they don't want to answer. That isn't facilitating civil discourse....it's avoiding accountability.\n\nRegardless of where you stand, it should be an expectation, not a privilege, to directly engage with your Congressman. This isn't about red or blue, this is about democracy. This is a peaceful protest, and we intend to be civil yet firm.\n\nThe address is as follows.\nBurlison Springfield District Office\n3232 E. Ridgeview St.\nSpringfield, MO 65804\n",

Join us for an online Intro to Bannering, a visual tactic Backbone Campaign has been leading on for the last 23 years! Thursday, March 13th at 5pm Pacific /7pm Central /8pm Eastern RSVP for the zoom link. At this workshop, we'll walk through the materials we use and how to put together a banner. We'll show you how to \"rig\" your banner to poles and tips for safely and legally deploying it on a freeway overpass. (These banners also work great in marches, at events behind a speaker, at intersections, ferry terminals and more.) We'll provide info on how you can get one of our banner kits to create and deploy banners in your community - or if you want to source your own materials, we'll have suggestions on resources. Overpass bannering is a highly visible and 100% legal way for folks to take action together. It only takes 2-4 people and an hour of time to reach tens of thousands of people and make them feel less alone - and maybe inspire them to stand up as well!",

Chicken Nick recently cut Medicaid which will affect up to 250,000 Alaskans, and even you when our hospitals and care givers that draw much of their revenue from Medicaid. There are even plans to cut Medicare.\n\nThat’s why we’re bringing CHICKEN NICK straight to his fancy dinner party! Our very own Chicken Nick (yes, a person in a full chicken suit) will be there to remind everyone that Begich clucks for billionaires, not for you.\n\nAnd you need to be there, with your signs to oppose any cuts in Medicaid, and generally demand that CHICKEN NICK stand up for Alaskans.\n\nHe joined the DOGE Caucus, proving he’s more loyal to Elon Musk and than to Alaskans.\n\nAnd when it’s time to answer for his actions? He’s too chicken to face the people!\n\nIf Begich won’t face Alaskans, we’ll bring the truth to his doorstep.

It's a good time and we get a lot of positive feedback from passing cars. It might seem like a small thing but every little bit helps. And it feels good to do something so come on down!\n\nElon Musk and DOGE are engaged in an administrative coup of the federal government. They have taken control of the federal payment system and are unilaterally suspending funds appropriated by congress, in clear violation of the Constitution.\n\nThey have already caused immense harm by dismantling USAID and have set their sights on everything from the FAA to Social Security next. Make no mistake, their end goal is the destruction of the US Federal Government and its ability to check corporate power and provide basic services to citizens.\n\nHow this develops in Washington remains to be seen, but as US citizens we can exercise our 1st Amendment right to peacefully protest. Elon Musk's net worth is largely based on Tesla stock, which is currently valued at 20X that of other car companies. Driving down the share price is a direct attack on Elon's power.\n\nThis is a non-violent action to raise awareness and help to drive down Tesla stock. We can legally protest on the sidewalk as long as we don't obstruct pedestrian or vehicle traffic. This location has plenty of room on the sidewalk and visibility to passing cars.",

Gone are thousands of civil service workers across the United States and foreign countries, with thousands more to follow. Abruptly fired staff include air traffic controllers and workers at nuclear plants. They're canceling leases for offices nationwide that house Social Security, Indian Health Board, CIA, CDC, NIH, Small Business Administration, Public Defender Service, US Fish and Wildlife, Farm Service Administration, Geological Survey, Mine Safety, FBI, EPA, and countless more programs critical to the functioning of our government and society. They've pulled the plug on all DEIA policies, launched mass deportations, broken the Department of Justice, installed an \"Office of Faith\" in the White House, ransacked the Department of Education, IRS, and Social Security, and removed all guardrails that have kept such abuse of power in check. And that's just a few of their ongoing illegal and unconstitutional \"efficiencies.\"\n\nJoin us to say NO to the wanton, sadistic, racist, bigoted, and corrupt plans of the Heritage Foundation, an ultraconservative think tank backed by billionaires.",

Now he and his allies are throwing a tantrum and attempting to silence organizers fighting back against his takeover of the US government - boo hoo!\nElon donated $250 million to Trump's campaign to purchase – and tank – the federal government. He's slashing critical services. He's gutting federal agencies that protect our food and health. Many, many people will die because of Elon's actions.\nNazis Elon and Trump should know that wannabe dictators who dismantle our government will be resisted and defeated. As we write, they are undermining the rule of law to disappear Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent resident, for exercising his right to free speech. This is attempted authoritarianism. Elon is an outright fascist who will take any opportunity to sacrifice human well-being so he can hoard power and money.\nWhat we're doing is working. We are tanking Elon's wealth. We won't back down.\n\nJoin us to make this the largest NYC Tesla Takedown action yet — and show that Elon's stunts will mean even more of us will rise up!",
