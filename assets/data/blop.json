In protest of the wide variety of Trump–Musk led anti-democratic activities that are occurring, I decided to organize a motorcoach protest trip to NC Senators Tillis and Budd’s Raleigh field offices. I’m calling it my “We Are Not Fools” protest. In only 2 days I filled a 50 person motor coach with friends and neighbors who want to be heard. It is a long shot to expect a meeting with a Senator. I’m hopeful for a meeting with staff. I won’t be surprised if neither occurs and we have a walking protest.\nYou can do it too! Help support this idea. On April 1st call or visit your respective Republican Senator and Representatives offices and tell them in no uncertain term that you will not be treated as a fool any longer. Tell them that you vote. Tell them that you will hold them accountable for the Trump – Musk anti-democracy actions that are occurring. Drive your car, charter a bus (like me), walk, ride a bike. Make your voice heard. Be prepared, be peaceful, be persistent.\nOn this April Fools Day tell Republicans that you are not a fool and that you will NOT BE FOOLED any longer.\nWe have power. USE IT.\n#wearenotfools\n@rangmran.bsky.social See less",

We are fighting back!\n\nThey're taking everything they can get their hands on—our health care, our data, our jobs, our services—and daring the world to stop them. This is a crisis, and the time to act is now.\n\n🚨 On Saturday, April 5th, we're taking to the streets to fight back with a clear message: Hands off! 🚨\n\nThis mass mobilization day is our message to the world that we do not consent to the destruction of our government and our economy for the benefit of Trump and his billionaire allies. Alongside Americans across the country, we are marching, rallying, and protesting to demand a stop the chaos and build an opposition movement against the looting of our country.\n\nA core principle behind all Hands Off! events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.\n\nCheck out handsoff2025.com for more information.",

TOGETHER\n\n“The time is always right to do what is right.”\nwww.gadfifty.org\n\nWE THE PEOPLE DEMAND...\nREMOVE\n- We the people demand that the offending elected officials be removed from office. President Donald Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance, and all cabinet officials appointed since January 20, 2025, must resign or be impeached and removed by Congress.\n\nREVERSE\n- We the people demand that all executive orders issued since January 20, 2025, be fully reversed. D.O.G.E. and Elon Musk must be removed from influence in government, and illegally fired federal employees must be reinstated to their former positions with back pay.\n\nRECLAIM\n- We the people demand that government work for us. We demand a government of the people, by the people, and for the people — not the billionaire class. Therefore, Citizens United must be overturned — by Supreme Court decision or Constitutional Amendment — and followed by aggressive campaign finance reform designed to give all Americans a fair voice in government. Executive overreach must be controlled by both the Legislature and the Judiciary, so we are never again ruled by kings.",
