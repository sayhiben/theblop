SUMMARY:Indivisible Roseville - May Day Strong: We are the Many
DESCRIPTION:Across the country—from fruit fields in California to classr
 ooms in Chicago\, from kitchens in Queens to loading docks in Atlanta—wo
 rking people are rising up. We are demanding a country that puts our famil
 ies over their fortunes—public schools over private profits\, healthcare
  over hedge funds\, housing over homelessness. Musk\, Trump and their fell
 ow profiteers are trying to create a race to the bottom—on wages\, on be
 nefits\, on dignity itself. They want to erase labor rights\, break our un
 ions\, and silence immigrant voices.\n\nPrivate\, sign up for details
