SUMMARY:Protest to Preserve our Democracy!
LOCATION:1 N New York Rd\, Galloway\, NJ
DESCRIPTION:Since our Congressman\, Jeff Van Drew\, is too chicken to meet
  with his constituents\, let's meet him at his fundraiser. Van Drew keeps 
 voting against the interests of the people of NJ Congressional District 2.
  Let's remind him that we won't stand for cuts to Medicaid\, Medicare\, an
 d Social Security. We won't stand idly by while he refuses to step in whil
 e our democracy is dismantled. Bring your signs and let's remind our Congr
 essman that we aren't going anywhere.\n\nOn Route 9 Across from The Smithv
