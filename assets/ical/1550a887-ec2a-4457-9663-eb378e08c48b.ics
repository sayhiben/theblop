SUMMARY:NO KINGS
LOCATION:7th Street & Main Street\, Windsor\, CO
DESCRIPTION:Our peaceful movement is only getting bigger and stronger. “
 NO KINGS” is more than just a slogan—it’s the foundation our nation 
 was built upon. Born in the streets\, carried by millions in chants and on
  posters\, it echoes from city blocks to rural town squares\, uniting peop
 le across this country to fight dictatorship together. In America\, we don
 ’t have kings\, and we won’t back down against chaos\, corruption\, an
 d cruelty. Grow our movement and join us. A core principle behind all No K
 ings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participan
 ts to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disag
 ree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any ki
 nd\, including those legally permitted\, should not be brought to events.\
