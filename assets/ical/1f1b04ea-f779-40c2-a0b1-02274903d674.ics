SUMMARY:Women Rise\, We All Rise
LOCATION:1499 Fruitvale Avenue\, Oakland\, CA
DESCRIPTION:Join us on Sunday\, March 23 as we bust myths about the origin
 s of women’s oppression and discuss what is needed in today’s struggle
 \, for the full liberation of all women. Why are women oppressed? Is patri
 archy just the natural state of affairs? What is actually needed for women
 ’s liberation? Join us this Sunday\, March 23 at 3pm at the Oakland Libe
 ration Center to discuss what a working class feminism\, for everyone\, ev
 erywhere\, looks like. To fight for our liberation\, we need to understand
  what we are fighting against and what is needed to win. Because a woman
 ’s place is in the struggle! All genders are encouraged to attend!\n\nOa
