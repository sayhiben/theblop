SUMMARY:Tesla Takedown Returns!
LOCATION:7 Fadem Rd\, Springfield\, NJ
DESCRIPTION:Back once again. Our first Tesla Takedown protests have drawn 
 many hundreds of people so we are coming back again! Let's show the unelec
 ted billionaire Elon Musk and his co-president that we won't let them run 
 roughshod over our Constitution or our federal government. This location a
 lso happens to be in Tom Kean Jr's congressional district (NJ-7) so let's 
 make sure we keep demanding he stops hiding and hosts a public town hall. 
 DETAILS: Meet at the Starbucks on Maplewood Ave at 11:30am if you'd like t
 o carpool. Grab a few friends or neighbors and bring your creative signs\,
  your rage\, and your voices! We'll gather on Fadem Road behind Staples wa
 lk to together to the front of the dealership.\n\nRt. 22 (next to the Spri
 ngfield Tesla dealership)
