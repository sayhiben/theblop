SUMMARY:Not Above the Law
LOCATION:Shelburne Road\, South Burlington\, VT
DESCRIPTION:This protest is specifically to communicate disapproval for th
 e presidential administration. His executive overreach and unconstitutiona
 l actions are a threat to America's democracy. He recently acted in direct
  opposition to a federal court order and this is unacceptable. If he is un
 able to act within the boundaries of the law\, then he needs to resign or 
 be impeached.\n\n
